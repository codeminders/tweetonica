                <p>
                  <b>Tweetonica</b> allows to manage
                  your <a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank_">Twitter</a>
                  contacts and organize them into groups. For example:
                  <i>"Colleagues"</i>, <i>"Friends"</i>, <i>"Family"</i>, 
                  <i>"News"</i>, <i>"Celebrities"</i>, etc.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Each group gets its own RSS feed which you can add
                  to your favorite RSS reader such as
                  <a href="http://reader.google.com" target="_blank">Google Reader</a>,
                  <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/INDIVIDUALS/NETNEWSWIRE/" target="_blank">NetNewsWire</a> or <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/individuals/feeddemon/default.aspx" target="_blank">FeedDemon</a>. You can click on RSS icon to
                  add a feed to your reader or you can import all your
                  group feeds at once using OPML file we provide.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This unique approach helps you to combat Twitter
                  infromation explosion and easily follow thousands of
                  people without missing important updates. For example
                  you may read updates from your close friends several
                  times thoughtout the day, but check tweets from other
                  people once per day.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Not only we help to organize your tweets into groups
                  - we also make it easier for you to read
                  them. Unlike twitter web interface we try to display
                  all depth of information embedded in tweets. If
                  somebody tweets image or video using popular service
                  such as YFrog, YouTube, Twitpic or Mobypic we will
                  show you a clickable thumbnails or embedded video
                  player. All URLs are converted into links. Hash
                  tags, user mentions (e.g. <i>@tweetonica</i>) and stock
                  symbols (e.g. <i>$AAPL</i>) are also converted into links.
                </p>

                <p>
                  A word about security: Tweetonica is
                  using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth"
                  target="_blank">OAuth</a>, so we never ask for your
                  twitter password. You will be redirected to
                  Twitter.com web site and will be authenticated there
                  to give Tweetonica permission to access your
                  account. You can always revoke this permission
                  anytime you want from Twitter web site.  All RSS and
                  OPML feeds we generate are password protected.
                </p>
