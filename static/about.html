                <h1>About Tweetonica</h1>
                     <p>Tweetonica allows to manage your Twitter contacts and organize them into groups. Each group gets its own RSS feed which you can add to your favorite RSS reader.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     You can:
                     <ul>
                        <li> Create groups of contacts</li>
                        <li> Move contacts between groups</li>
                        <li> Rename and delete groups</li>
                        <li> Get RSS feeds, one per group</li>
                        <li> Import all your groups RSS feeds into your RSS reader as handy OPML file</li>
                        <li> You can even subscribe to OPML feed so you reader will be updated with new groups as you create them</li>
                        
                     </ul>   
                <p>
                  A word about security: Tweetonica is using OAuth, so
                  we never ask for your twitter password. You will be
                  redirected to Twitter.com web site and will be 
                  authenticated there to give Tweetonica permission 
                  to access your account. You can always revoke this 
                  permission anytime you want from Twitter web site. 
                  All RSS and OPML feeds we generate are password 
                  protected.
                </p>
