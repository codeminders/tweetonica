            <p>First of all, if you do not know what RSS is, you
            should try it out. RSS is very useful for managing
            information flows from multiple sources. Try a product
            like
              <a href="http://reader.google.com" target="_blank">Google Reader</a>,
              <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/INDIVIDUALS/NETNEWSWIRE/" target="_blank">NetNewsWire</a> or <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/individuals/feeddemon/default.aspx" target="_blank">FeedDemon</a>.</p>
            <p>If you do not want to use RSS, you will have to wait a bit to take an advantage of Tweetonica features. Current (beta) version provides information only in RSS format. Next version will have a web interface to read your groups without a RSS reader.
            </p>

            <a class="faqentry" name="features"><h2>What can I do with Tweetonica?</h2></a>
            <p>You can:
            <ul>
                <li>Create new contact groups</li>
                <li>Rename existing groups</li>
                <li>Delete groups</li>
                <li>Move your contacts from one group to another</li>
                <li>Download an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML" target="_blank">OPML</a> file and import it into your favorite RSS reader</li>
                <li>Have links that point to RSS feeds of group's users posts</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <a class="faqentry" name="whyus"><h2>Twitter provides RSS feeds. Why not just use them?</h2></a>
            <p>Twitter provides a single RSS feed for updates from all
            the people you follow. If you follow more than a handful of
            people it becomes difficult to manage all updates from all
            the contacts in single flow. Some updates are more important
            than others and you would want to be sure you won't miss
            them among hundreds of updates you receive daily.</p>
            
            <p>
              Not only do we help to organize your tweets into groups, 
              but we also make it easier for you to read them. Unlike
              the twitter RSS feed we try to display the full depth of
              information embedded in tweets. If somebody tweets an image
              or video using popular services such as YFrog, YouTube,
              Twitpic, or Mobypic, we will show you a clickable
              thumbnails or the embedded video player. All URLs are
              converted into links. Hash tags, user mentions
              (e.g. <i>@tweetonica</i>), and stock symbols
              (e.g. <i>$AAPL</i>) are also converted into links.
            </p>

            <a class="faqentry" name="move"><h2>How can I move a contact into a group?</h2></a>
            <p>Either drag and drop the contact into the desired group at the left or click on the icon next to the user's picture to select a destination group</p>

            <p>No contacts are lost. All existing contacts are moved to the 'Uncategorized' group</p>

            <a class="faqentry" name="security"><h2>How secure is it?</h2></a>
            <p>We take security very seriously. We are using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth" target="_blank">OAuth</a>, so we never ask for your password. You rather enter it at the Twitter web site which gives us authorization to access your account. This authorization could be withdrawn anytime from your preferences at the Twitter.com web site.</p>
